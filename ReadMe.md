#Forum System
Technologies Used: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, C#, and ASP.NET 

This project was a forum system that allows users to create new threads, create posts under those threads, and reply to the posts as they choose. We also implemented the ability to like a post.
This forum system was developed for our final capstone at Moore Norman Technology Center. The second year of the program, which this project was completed focused on learning Systems Analysis and Design concepts and working on a team. My team consisted of 4 team members. I was able to get most of the UML diagrams and some of the code used.
I apologize for not having everything to show for this project, I just never thought about keeping my code until I entered college (I really wish I did).
